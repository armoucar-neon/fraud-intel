# DSPy App

- Read @docs/SCENARIO.md
- Read @docs/DEMO.md
- Check how to use DSPy properly with context7.
- Implement what's being asked in @docs/DEMO.md. Make sure to:
  - use DSPy concepts of defining signatures;
  - use the suitable modules together with the signatures for improved results;
  - structure the folders for our synthetic datasets;
  - implement the examples (dspy.Example) and dspy evaluations for these new modules;
- @main.py is the entry point for the app. The demo should be implemented in the @src dir though.
