  "draft_narrative": "Application exhibits clear synthetic identity patterns with tampered documents showing edge artifacts and failed MRZ validation. Rooted Android device previously used for 11 blocked applications across 7 different identities. Behavioral indicators include copy-paste of personal data, minimal digital footprint (12-day email domain, 8-day phone), and abandonment when proof of address requested. High likelihood of organized synthetic identity creation for future bust-out fraud.",
